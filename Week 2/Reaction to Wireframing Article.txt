It was interesting to see that concepts I have learned in other classes apply to web design as well. 
For example, in my class on innovation and entrepreneurship, EG 1001, it is repeatedly stressed that you need to understand the wants and needs of your target demographic. If you don’t, you may have an amazing product or idea that no one actually wants to buy. This is similar to how this article’s author, Lissa Aguilar, stresses the need to understand what your stakeholders want. 
Also, in the classes I’ve taken that involved essay writing, I’ve always found that it is best to fully develop an outline first, before writing the essay. This helps you get a feel for what the finished essay will be like, as well as pinpoint any flaws or holes in the arguments. Similarly, wire framing seems to serve a similar purpose, in that it allows the developer to see flaws in their design.
